## Documentation for Business Card

This project utilizes HTML and CSS code to create a personalized artist business card website. Featuring working social media links and authentic digital artwork, this site stands as the first project I have created through this method of coding, thus requiring constant adjustments, learning, and error correcting. The idea for this project begain as Figma mock-ups and brought fruition through customization of a vertical card template created by previous UMass Dartmouth student Nathan Wright. All artwork presented on this site is inspired from original characters and made specifically as personal branding that displays skills while simultaneously capturing the audience's interest. The fonts utilized include Gabriela as a decorative header and Lato as smaller fine text. The color palette selected from the card's illustration demonstrates the use of high contrasting colors for easy legibility. However, due to the learning curve, this project does not yet make use of image alt text descriptions.
